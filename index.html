									<h3><a href="#">The Battle of Bull Run...</a></h3>
									<h4><a href="#">The Second American Civil War Has Begun...</a></h4>
									<h5><a href="#">And It Started Over Vaccines...</a></h5>
									<p><span class="date">April 21st , 2015</span> -Tens of thousands of parents of vaccine injured children, in California, woke up one morning, not long ago, to find that their Democratic Party controlled legislature had given up any semblance of representing the people that elected them.  They had become only about special interest.  Money talks.</p>
									<p>I'm surprised that the Democrats still let citizens approach government buildings in Sacramento, the State capitol, any more. (sarcasm intended).</p>
									<p>In a busy life, the kind the year 2015 generates, it isn't hard to lose track of what's happening in your State capitol.  Parents need to get to work.  Get the kids to school. Buy groceries.  Wait in line at the gas station.  Survive.</p>

									<h5><a href="#">Mandatory Vaccine Legislation, like  									California's SB277, Is a Last Ditch Effort  									To Save a Totally Worthless Project -  									Vaccines, and Everything They Claim to Stand  									For...</a></h5>
									<p><span class="date">May 28th, 2015 </span> - There is one important incident that indicates what is REALLY happening in the Vaccine Wars.  President of Merck's Vaccine Division - Julie Gerberding, just sold half of her Merck stock, cashing out at about 2.5 million US dollars.</p>

<p>This is a process called "rats leaving a sinking ship..."  Gerberding, it may be said, is the architect of today's  bloated, useless, dangerous, damaging to the public, Vaccine Program.  Merck makes ALL required childhood vaccines in the US, and 90% of all recommended adult vaccines.</p>

<p>It was then, during the arrangements for the hearing, that the Canary Party/Health Choice people got my attention.  After facts came to the surface, about what actually happened to push Hooker, and the questions for the CDC leadership out of the picture, the Canary Party/Health Choice groups started to get pushed out of autism leadership.  They are NOT, for instance, welcome at Autism One, and when one of their people tried to attend this year (2015), Security was called to escort them off the property.  <a class="view-more" href="#">MORE</a>

								<p>By: <span class="by"> Dr. T. R. Shantha, MD, PhD, FACA</span></p>
								<p><span class="date">October 18th, 2014</span> - The news about Ebola and its possible fatal end is everywhere in the news - created by many hypochondriacs.  The virus is deadly and spreads only by contact with body fluids.  Once the person gets the infection, their life hangs on a thin thread.  Mortality from the infection is as high as 50% - 60%.   Another deadly disease that kills about 35,000 people in the east, mostly young, is rabies, which is 100% fatal compared to 40-60% mortality by Ebola virus infection. Ebola will be and is curable, but not rabies. </p>
								<p>Coming back to Ebola, it does not spread by air or touching people. It spreads only through body fluids contact, and use of contaminated needles and from animals to humans eating contaminated meat. <a href="#" class="view-more">MORE</a></p>
